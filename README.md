## Project Title
Assignment to create a automation system for connecting developer team, testing team and production team.

### Getting Started



#### Prerequisites

For doing this project you need to have yum configured for RHEL8 and install and configure docker and jenkins.
Developer team need to have git in their system.


### Steps
#### Getting started with developer end.

First need to create a GitHub repo for centalised source code management.
Then developer can clone the  repo to his local directory.
```
git clone <url of git repo>

```

Now copy his website html files to the folder and do a commit

```
until finished
```
and to first push to origin from master branch.
```
until finished
```
Now, for further changes and testing, developer can create branches, modify/add code, do commits!
```
until finished
```
Create a hook, for automation. Automate push after each commit.
```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Running the tests 
For doing tests on the developer modified code we , need to send it to the testing environment.These environments will be created using docker images. And we will automate this sending data from github developers branch to testing environment using Jenkins.

#### Setting up jenkins and creating the Jobs/tasks.

Currently we havent created the testing part, so it will be a manual check that if the site is working or not.

```
Give an example
```

#### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
